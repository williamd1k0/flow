Flow is a simple Flutter app that implements a productivity technique called **Flowtime**.

The Pomodoro technique is efficient for tasks you find boring, but having to take a break when you are 100% concentrated in something you like might be annoying.
That's why the **Flowtime** technique exists: take appropriate breaks without loosing your *flow*.

## How does it work?
The time you worked is multiplied by 20%, and that's the break time you'll take.
E.g, if you worked for 60 minutes, you'll take a 10 minute break, if you worked for 2 hours, you'll take a 24 minute break.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by a Linux Flathub app called [Flowtime](https://github.com/Diego-Ivan/Flowtime).
I just wanted to bring the concept of Flowtime to systems other than Linux.
If you are using Linux and prefer a more *native* implementation (vala+libadwaita), I strongly recommend using the Flathub app.

## Features
- Assistant for the Flowtime working technique
- Assisted time calculations for breaks
- Notification that alerts you when your break is done (WIP)
- Built-in dark and light modes
